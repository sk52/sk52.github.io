In this post I will cover:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction</li>\n<li>Ideas going forward</li>\n<li>Setting up a basic Gatsby blog using the <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog\">Gatsby Starter Blog</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>I’m a software engineer living and working in London, UK.</p>\n<p>The first topic which I’ll be writing about is in fact about this very site - I’m keen to document the journey, starting with a basic Gatsby template and modifying it to suit my needs.</p>\n<h2>Ideas</h2>\n<p>Things that I’ve got in mind for future changes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deploying the site using GitHub Pages (if you’re reading this then it’s safe to assume this task is complete!)</li>\n<li>Moving towards using a headless CMS rather than markdown for my blog posts</li>\n<li>Setting up a basic CI/CD pipeline to suit my needs, likely GitHub Actions to begin with for easy deployment to GitHub Pages. Although I would like to extend this to handle auto redeploys on publishing new posts in the CMS of choice</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Setting up a basic Gatsby blog</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The first step is to install the Gatsby CLI globally by running <code class=\"language-text\">npm install -g gatsby-cli</code> as documented at <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/gatsby-cli/\">www.gatsbyjs.com</a></li>\n<li>Next it’s as simple as running the Gatsby <code class=\"language-text\">new</code> command specifying which starter template to use. In this case, I used the blog starter by running the command <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby new blog-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog</code></li>\n<li>Once installed, <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby develop</code> will run the new blog locally on the default port 8000</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It really is as simple as that, Gatsby makes it super quick and easy to get a basic template set up. To create new content just create a new folder in the <code class=\"language-text\">content/blog</code> and start writing in markdown. Gatsby will rebuild and your changes will be visible on localhost.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"First Post","date":"March 27, 2021","description":null}},"previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/setting-up-ci-cd/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Deploying a Gatsby Site to GitHub Pages Using GitHub Actions CI/CD"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1eb72ed8-a79c-5eb9-a755-cf8f77cd3c04","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"deb00dd2-f49d-5293-b9b0-472b6a8f8cc7"}},"staticQueryHashes":["230163734","2841359383"]}
